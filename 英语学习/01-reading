a growing number of business leaders say their fear their companies will not survive the next 10 years because of pressure from climate change and new technology.  
That information comes from a new opinion by the consulting company PwC.  
PwC questions over 4700 chief executive officers or ceos from 105 countries and territories.  
It released the survey results on January 15.  
The survey's release came as business leaders, political leaders and activists gathered for the world economic forum's yearly meeting in Davos,Switzerland.
